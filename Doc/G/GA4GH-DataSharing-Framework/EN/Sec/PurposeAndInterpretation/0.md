1.0.sec=The purpose of this Framework is to provide a principled and practical framework for the responsible sharing of genomic and health-related data. Its primary goals are to:

1.1.sec=Protect and promote the welfare, rights, and interests of individuals from around the world in genomic and health-related data sharing, particularly those who contribute their data for biomedical research;

1.2.sec=Complement laws and regulations on privacy and personal data protection, as well as policies and codes of conduct for the ethical governance of research;

1.3.sec=Foster responsible data sharing and oversight of research data systems;

1.4.sec=Establish a framework for greater international data sharing, collaboration and good governance;

1.5.sec=Serve as a dynamic instrument that can respond to future developments in the science, technology, and practices of genomic and health-related data sharing;

1.6.sec=Serve as a tool for the evaluation of responsible research by research ethics committees and data access committees; and

1.7.sec=Provide overarching principles to be respected in developing legally-binding tools such as data access agreements.

2.Ti=Interpretation

2.sec=Without ascribing legal meaning, this Framework should be interpreted in good faith and is to be understood as a whole. The Foundational Principles and Core Elements are to be understood as complementary and interrelated, as appropriate and relevant in different contexts, countries and cultures. This Framework will be supported by Policies for guidance in particular issues such as, but not limited to, ethical governance, privacy and security, and consent. For the purposes of this Framework, “data sharing” includes data transfer or data exchange between data users, or where data are made available to secondary researchers, either openly or under specified access conditions.
