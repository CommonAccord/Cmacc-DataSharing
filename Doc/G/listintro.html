This is a collection of "prose objects," codified legal documents, forms for a generalized framework for data sharing and set of supporting materials.  These are initially focused on sharing of information relating to epidemics among NGOs and from the private sector.

You can use these prose objects privately by creating an "instance" of CommonAccord - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-06FzulLpQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-06FzulLpQ</a>.<br>

Transacting platforms can integrate them by writing their own rendering engine.
