Note=Articles 4.2 and 4.3 Annotation: The data management plan will describe specific responsibilities the data provider and data recipient have in the data sharing activities planned. In addition, the Model Agreement identifies more general responsibilities for the data provider (Article 4.2 above) and the data recipient (Article 4.3 below). A number of these responsibilities arise from the different legal systems under which the data provider and data recipient operate. Other responsibilities address more functional issues, such as the data recipient’s responsibility to comply with any restrictions on the transfer of shared data to third parties.
