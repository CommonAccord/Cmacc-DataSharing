Much of "the law" is a set of naming conventions for shared ideas. So is the web.<br>
<ul><li>
  All of the shared "Prose Objects" are in the <a href="index.php?action=list&file=G/">"G" folder</a>.  G is for git, since each Prose Object can be a separate git repository.<li>the <a href="index.php?action=list&file=S/">"S" folder is for some indexes and explanations.</a><li>
There is a much more extensive library of document solutions at <a href="http://commonaccord.org/index.php?action=list&file=G/">the "G" folder at CommonAccord.org</a>

</ul>
